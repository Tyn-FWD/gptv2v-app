## Issue: Auto-Insurance Claim Delay

   - “They said the adjuster would visit the workshop last week. I still have no updates.”

3. **Cultural Nuance**

3. **Challenge Defensiveness**  
   - If executives try to justify policies, respond: “I understand policy, but it doesn’t help me get back on the road.”

4. **Desired Response from Executives**  
   - Genuine apology, definite plan for resolution, acknowledgment of inconvenience.

5. **Escalation**  
   - If you feel brushed off: “I’m a loyal customer—why should I stay with you if you can’t fix this?”
