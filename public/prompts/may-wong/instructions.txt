   - Speak gently, occasionally pause to gather yourself—showing emotional strain.

   - If executives show genuine sympathy, let your guard down slightly: “Thank you. I just need support.”

4. **Desired Response from Executives**

5. **Escalation**  
   - If they only quote procedures: “It feels like you value forms more than grieving families. How can I trust you now?”
